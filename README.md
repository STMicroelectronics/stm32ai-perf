# MLPerf™ Tiny Deep Learning Benchmarks for STM32 devices
The goal of MLPerf™ Tiny is to provide a representative set of deep neural nets
and benchmarking code to compare performance between embedded devices. These devices
typically run at between 10MHz and 250MHz, and can perform inference using less
then 50mW of power.

For this Benchmark we are suggesting 3 Boards:

- [NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h7a3zi-q.html#sample-buy)
- [NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-u575zi-q.html#sample-buy)
- [NUCLEO-L4R5ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l4r5zi.html#sample-buy)

In this guide, we will learn how to generate the projects for the previous boards.

## Before You Start
You need to download and install the following software:

- [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)   ( v6.4.0 )

### NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q Projects

In this section we will explain how to generate the different benchmark projects for the **NUCLEO-H7A3ZI-Q** board.
We will take the Image Classification benchmark project as an example and then exactly the same steps should be repeated for the rest of the scenarios (Anomaly Detection, Keyword Spotting and Person Detection)

### Generate the project using STM32CubeMX
**1. Download the [Image Classification](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/blob/master/benchmark/training/image_classification/trained_models) model and then save it under**
```bash
...\stm32ai-perf\STM32_H7A3ZI\image_classification
```
You should have something like this to start:
![plot](./doc/folder_structure.JPG)

**2. Open the .ioc file and follow the next steps to generate your project template:**

![Alt Text](./doc/H7A3_config.gif)


### Configure and build the project using STM32CubeIDE
After generating the project using STM32CubeMX you should have something like this in your workspace:

![plot](./doc/cube_ide_project.JPG)

**1. Open the .cproject file and follow the next steps to configure your project:**

![Alt Text](./doc/cube_ide_config_final.gif)

**2. Modify the main.c file:**

2.1 Open main.c located under Project Explorer:

/* please refer to the startup file (startup_stm32h7xx.s).                    */
/******************************************************************************/
```
2.3 Configure the TCM memory on the STM32H7A3 :
<br> Under the project, open the file called **STM32H7A3ZITXQ_FLASH.ld**.
Under this file : 
<br> - Set data sections, into DTCMRAM1 :
```bash
  /* Initialized data sections goes into RAM, load LMA copy after code */
  .data :
  {
    . = ALIGN(4);
    _sdata = .;        /* create a global symbol at data start */
    *(.data)           /* .data sections */
    *(.data*)          /* .data* sections */
    *(.RamFunc)        /* .RamFunc sections */
